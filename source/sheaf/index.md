The sheaf seminar series is Professor Samson Abramsky's weekly group meeting. Our meetings take place on Tuesdays at 2 PM UK time. We are currently meeting in a hybrid manner, with both online and in-person participants. 

Meetings usually consist of an informal presentation covering published or in progress work on the broad research interests of the group. If you would like to participate please write me an [email](mailto:amin.karamlou@cs.ox.ac.uk). The current schedule is available below.
